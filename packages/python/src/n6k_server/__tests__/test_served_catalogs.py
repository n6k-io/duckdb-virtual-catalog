"""Which catalogs a zero-argument `CALL n6k_serve_*()` picks.

The rule lives in C++ (`n6k::ResolveServedCatalogs`) and most of it is asserted in
`test/sql/n6k_server.test`. What that runner cannot express is a connection whose
*startup* database is a file: it always opens in memory. That case is the whole
reason the rule tests for in-memory rather than just "the startup database", so it
is pinned here, where the connection can be opened against a path.

`n6k_testing_served_catalogs()` resolves the same list and returns it instead of
serving it — the serve functions block once bound.
