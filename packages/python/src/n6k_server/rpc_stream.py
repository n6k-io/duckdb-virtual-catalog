"""Host-backed RPC: serve `@rpc`-style Python functions, including generators.

The C++ server resolves an RPC name against the served DuckDB, so an RPC has to
be a catalog entry. A Python generator cannot be a table macro, and DuckDB's
Python API cannot register a table function at all — `create_function` is
scalar-only.

So this module registers three scalar UDFs (open/next/close, speaking Arrow IPC)
and asks the extension to build a table function over them, via
`provider_create_stream_function`, which `virtual_catalog_provider` provides. The
result is an ordinary catalog entry: the
reactor resolves it like any other table function and drives the generator one
Arrow batch per `RESP_CHUNK`, paced by the client's credit and closed on cancel,
and `SELECT * FROM <catalog>.main.<name>(...)` works locally with no server.

## Registering

```python
import pyarrow as pa
from n6k_server.rpc_stream import StreamingRpc, register_rpc_streams

TICK = pa.schema([("seq", pa.int64()), ("value", pa.float64())])


async def random_walk(scalars, table):
    value = 100.0
    for seq in range(scalars[0]):
        value += random.uniform(-1.0, 1.0)
        yield pa.record_batch({"seq": [seq], "value": [value]}, schema=TICK)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)


def connect(ws):
    con = duckdb.connect(config={"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"})
    load_virtual_catalog_provider(con)
    con.execute("ATTACH ':memory:' AS db")
    register_rpc_streams(con, catalog="db", registry={"random_walk": (StreamingRpc(random_walk), TICK)})
    return con
```

`registry` is `{name: (callable, pa.Schema)}`. The callable takes
`(scalars, table)` — the RPC's positional arguments, and the rows a
`RPC_TABLE` call pushed (`None` for `RPC_SCALAR`) — and is either:

- wrapped in `StreamingRpc`, returning an async iterator of `pa.RecordBatch`
  (or `pa.Table`), which may never end; or
- a plain callable returning one `pa.Table`, which is sent and ended.

The schema is declared, not inferred, because the wire sends `RESP_SCHEMA`
before the first batch — and a generator that has not yielded yet cannot say
what its columns are.

## Where the code runs

Generators are driven on `main_loop` (the loop running at registration), so
they see the same per-connection state as everything else the host serves —
one RPC can change what another is streaming mid-flight. Each batch costs one
thread hop from a DuckDB worker into that loop, so yield **batches**, not rows.

A finite callable runs directly on the worker thread, which is already off the
loop.
