"""The `exception_type` SSOT, and the three places it has to stay in step with.

`exception_type` is a closed set: the client reconstructs a DuckDB exception class
from it and treats anything it does not recognize as `IOException`. That fallback is
silent, so a wrong value does not fail — it just quietly strips the type off every
error. These tests are the fence around that.

The set previously lived in three hand-maintained places and had drifted;
`DependencyException` was documented and reachable but unmapped, so it went out as
`IOException`.
