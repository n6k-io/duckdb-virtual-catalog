"""n6k protocol: the wire format, and the codec for speaking it.

This package does not *serve* the protocol — the server is `src/n6k_server`, a
DuckDB extension, reached from Python by handing it a socket
(`n6k_server.pump.serve_and_close_connection`). What remains here is the definition and the
codec: `protocol.py` is the single source of truth that the TypeScript and C++
mirrors are generated from, and `pack_frame`/`unpack_frame` let a Python client or
a test speak the wire directly.
