"""Filter-clause types and Arrow helpers for the `Provider` API.

Shape-compatible with pyarrow's tuple-form filter argument — a list of
`(col, op, value)` tuples, structurally identical to what
`pyarrow.parquet.read_table(filters=...)` and `pyarrow.dataset` accept.
Providers that read parquet can pass an n6k `filters` value straight to
pyarrow for the operators pyarrow understands; `is_null` and `is_not_null`
are n6k extras with no pyarrow tuple-form equivalent — use
`split_pyarrow_filters()` to partition them out, then apply the leftover
via `filter_and_project()`.
