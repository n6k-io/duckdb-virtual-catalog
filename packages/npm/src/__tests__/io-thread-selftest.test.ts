// producer pthreads write frames into their own ring and ring the doorbell after each write. Runs
// `SELECT * FROM n6k_selftest_io_thread_doorbell()`. On the coi (browser-threads) bundle it proves the
// doorbell futex wake + multi-ring drain loop (the core of the shared reactor) before that machinery
// is wired into WsClient; on native it proves the same loop over std::deque rings + a CV doorbell.
