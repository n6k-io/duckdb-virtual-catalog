"""ERR frames carry a real `exception_type`, from every server.

`exception_type` is a closed set of DuckDB class names; the client reconstructs the
matching exception from it and treats anything unrecognized as `IOException`. That
fallback is **silent**, so a server sending the wrong spelling does not fail — it just
strips the type off every error it ever reports.

That is precisely what the C++ server did: it sent `Exception::ExceptionTypeToString`,
which yields the display string ("Catalog") rather than the class name
("CatalogException"), so every typed error reached clients as an untyped IOException
while the tests that only ran against the Python mount stayed green. The fix put the
correspondence in src/common/n6k_exception_types.cpp, shared by both servers.

Run:
