// parks on a single standalone doorbell int32 in shared heap and drains TWO independent vsock rings
// when woken, while two producer pthreads write frames into their own ring and ring the doorbell
// after each write. It proves the doorbell futex wake + multi-ring drain loop (the core of the
// single-shared-I/O-thread reactor). Emits exactly one diagnostic row.
