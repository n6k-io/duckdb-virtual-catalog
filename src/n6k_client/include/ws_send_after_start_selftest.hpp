// Reactor::Start (exactly what WsClient::Connect does with HELLO) MUST reach the wire. ixwebsocket's
// WebSocket::sendMessage returns false and silently discards when the socket has not yet reached
// ReadyState::Open, so a writer thread that fires before the 101 arrives drops the frame and the
// connect can only ever time out. Stands up an in-process ix::WebSocketServer on loopback and emits
// exactly one diagnostic row.
