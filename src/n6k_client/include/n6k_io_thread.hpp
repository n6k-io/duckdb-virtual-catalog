// The single shared n6k I/O thread: ONE process-global consumer pthread that drains every
// attached catalog's RX ring (ring1) in duckdb's shared wasm heap, instead of one service pthread
// per catalog. It parks on one standalone doorbell int32 (rung by every pump after it publishes an
// inbound frame) and, when woken, drains all registered rings and delivers each frame via that
// channel's callback. Collapsing to one thread keeps n6k's emscripten-pool cost at 1 regardless of
// catalog count, which is what makes threads>1 viable with multiple catalogs.
//
// Lifecycle: a lazily-started singleton (first Instance()), torn down at static destruction. A
// reactor Registers its channel in Start and Unregisters in Stop/Abandon. Unregister BLOCKS on a
// quiesce handshake — the I/O thread acks once it has re-snapshotted without the channel and will
// never touch that ring again — which replaces the old per-reactor thread join as the barrier that
// gates ring Close + the JS free chain.
